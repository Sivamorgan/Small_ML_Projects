## Small_ML_Projects

Some of the projects that I have done while doing the Udemy Course Complete A.I. & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp from Zero to Mastery

1. ***Heart Disease Classification*** is a simple Classification project where I used the built-in classification algorithms like KNN, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest from scikit-learn

2.  ***Bulldozer-Price_prediction*** is a Regression Project where I used Random Forest Regressor (from scikit-learn) and did Hyperparameter tuning

3.  ***Dog Breed Identification*** is a Classification Project where I used Transfer Learning from torchvision pretrained models['efficientnet_b0','resnet50','mobilenet_v3_large'] and also wrapped them with Pytorch Lightning module for better Scalability (Also used Tensorboard Logger)
